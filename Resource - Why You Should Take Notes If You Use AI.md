## Summary

A guide to building a note-taking system that supports "context engineering" - the practice of providing rich context to AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. Argues that the shift from prompt engineering to context engineering is key to getting high-quality, personalised AI output.

## Key Points

- Prompt engineering is out, context engineering is in
- Tacit knowledge vs explicit knowledge matters for AI interaction
- 6 categories of notes support effective AI usage:
  1. Input notes
  2. Source of truth notes
  3. Judgement notes
  4. Framework notes
  5. Deep thinking notes
  6. Context notes
- Notes help you capture tacit knowledge to share with AI
- Claude Code demonstrated as example of context-aware AI
