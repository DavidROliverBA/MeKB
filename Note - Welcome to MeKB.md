# Welcome to MeKB

You've just started your personal knowledge base. Here's how to get the most from it.

## The Core Idea

**Capture → Connect → Compound**

1. **Capture** everything in daily notes - don't organise yet
2. **Connect** by adding `[[links]]` between related notes
3. **Compound** as connections reveal patterns and insights

## Quick Tips

- Start with `/daily` to create today's note
- Use `[[brackets]]` liberally - more links = more value
- Don't over-organise early - structure emerges naturally
- Review weekly to link orphan notes

## Your First Week

1. Create a daily note each day
2. Dump thoughts, links, ideas
3. When something recurs, give it a dedicated note
4. Link back to your daily notes
