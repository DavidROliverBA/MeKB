# 2026-02-04

## What's on my mind

Started my MeKB vault today. Excited to see how knowledge compounds over time.

## Today I learned

- MeKB uses plain markdown - works with any editor
- Wiki-links connect notes: [[Note - Welcome to MeKB]]
- Knowledge outlives tools

## Tasks

- [x] Set up MeKB vault
- [ ] Create my first few notes
- [ ] Explore the templates

## Notes

This is my first daily note. The beauty of this system is its simplicity - just markdown files that work anywhere.

## Links captured

- [[Concept - Event Sourcing]] - reviewed via /review
- [[Resource - Why You Should Take Notes If You Use AI]] - clipped YouTube video on context engineering
- [[Note - Voice Note 2026-02-04 1430]] - tested voice capture
- [[Person - Sarah Chen]] - caught up today
