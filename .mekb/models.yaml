# MeKB Model Preferences
# Informational only - Claude Code handles model selection.
# This documents recommended models for different task types.

default: sonnet

preferences:
  # Quick capture - fast, low cost, simple templates
  quick-capture:
    model: haiku
    tasks: [daily, meeting, task, person, note]
    rationale: "Speed over depth for simple template filling"

  # Research and exploration - parallel, isolated context
  research:
    model: haiku
    tasks: [q, search, related, orphans, graph]
    rationale: "Parallel subagents for read-only exploration"

  # Analysis and synthesis - balanced quality
  analysis:
    model: sonnet
    tasks: [ask, suggest, weekly, review, stale, connections]
    rationale: "Good reasoning at moderate cost"

  # Deep work - complex reasoning
  deep-work:
    model: opus
    tasks: [decisions, complex-analysis, vault-maintenance]
    rationale: "Maximum reasoning quality for important decisions"

# Trust levels aligned with security.json
trust:
  haiku: personal     # Can access public + personal
  sonnet: personal    # Can access public + personal
  opus: confidential  # Can access up to confidential (with ask)
  local: secret       # Local models can access everything
